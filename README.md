# Nuke Camera Animations and Effects
Takes care of the annoying camera highjacking and ugly camera effects during certain events, while you could much better use that time to look around to consider your next move.

One of the events was horse mounting for example. It locks your camera for 2 to 3 seconds to a weird and useless angle and zoom level. It also made moving the horse during that time unpredictable and just made up for bad situations altogether. The removed result is the following vid;

## INSTALLATION
[Snakebite](https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsolidvtpp/mods/106) is required to install the `.MGSV` file. Place the optional `NCAESettings.lua` file in the game directory where the .exe is. This way you can customize the mod to your liking. You can open the file with notepad. When you save the file the settings are automatically updated ingame, no restart required. Without the file the mod will nuke all by default.

## COMPATIBILITY
The mod should be pretty compatible across the board. The only file that i modify is:
```	
/Assets/tpp/level_asset/chara/player/game_object/TppPlayer2CallbackScript.lua
```
